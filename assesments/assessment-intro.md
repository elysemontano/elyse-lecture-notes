# Assessment Introduction

## What are assessments?
  - We will have 6 assessments total
  - Due on Monday morning
  - Assessments are not about creating perfect code and trying to get an A on the assignment.  We do these assessments for a few different reasons.  One is for you to see where you are at.  Two so that we can see where you are at and where you are struggling.  This helps us help you further.

## Links: 
You will receive a link from myself or Austin each week.  This week we will provide it in the main channel.  Following weeks will be sent individually.  If you do not receive an assessment link, it means that you have something you need to tend to with the previous weeks assessment.  I recommend cloning this to your desktop or you can create a folder on your desktop to store your assessments, just be sure you are using git commands in the correct folder!

      - Make sure to create a branch. 


## Git Process
- You will clone the assessment.
- add, commit, and push code


  - Open the repo
    - Let's look at the readme
    - Navigate to link for expectations
      - PLEASE READ THROUGH THIS THOUGHOUGLY!

  - Valid effort on each problem
      - By this I mean, are you looking at the output on your terminal, reading the error messages and troubleshooting 
      -  I am looking for code and notes that properly communicates that you have seen the outcome of your code, and made decisions on how to proceed based on that outcome.

      The whole point of this is to prepare you for the second half of the cohort where you will be doing this every day as a developer and going into interviews.

  - Psuedocode on code challenges is REQUIRED!
    - Pseudocode is not repeating the promp, but going into depth on the methods and logic you are using.  Always err on the side of OVER COMMUNICTION
    - If you are stuck, write out what you have tried, your thoughts behind it and what errors your are running into

  - Copying answers from the internet does not help you, it hurts you. You are encouraged to use resources such as the syllabus or google if you are not sure how to approach a problem (cause that is what developers do everyday), however simply copying code or answers does not show a valid effort and will be returned to you.

 
  - Once complete, submit a PR
  - DO NOT MERGE UNTIL PR IS APPROVED
  - We will review the PR and leave you feedback
  - Keep an eye out for if there are changes requested
  - Approval means you are good to merge and this means your assessment is complete


## Skill levels are NOT grades:
Skill level means that we are assessing your current level of understanding of the topics covered.

  - Incomplete: No answer, no pseudoscode, non working code without explanation, plagiarism (We will send this back to you!)
  - Complete: Bare minimum effort given (if you don't put in the effort, I won't either).  You get out of this what you put into this.
  - Novice: Provides pseudocode, code can output in the terminal (may not be accurate), answers are written in your own words (will provide feedback)
  - Advanced Beginner: pseudocode with proper vocab, correct output, your answers written in complete sentences and partially correct, researched answers written in complete sentences and provides adequate context and content
  - Competent: Detailed pseudoscode, correct content in terminal, your answers are thorough and will provide correct answers.


  I must see A VALID ATTEMPT ON EVERY QUESTION!
  - By this I mean, are you looking at the output on your terminal, reading the error messages and troubleshooting 
  -  I am looking for code and notes that properly communicate that signify that you have seen the outcome of your code, and made decisions on how to proceed based on that outcome.

  The whole point of this is to prepare you for the second half of the cohort where you will be doing this every day as a developer and going into interviews.
