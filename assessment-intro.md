# Assessment Introduction

## What are assessments?
  - We will have 6 assessments total
  - Due on Monday morning
  - Assessments are not about creating perfect code and trying to get an A on the assignment.  We do these assessments for a few different reasons.  One is for you to see where you are at.  Two so that we can see where you are at and where you are struggling.  This helps us help you further.

  - Copy link to assessment
    - This will create a new repo on your github account.  I recommend cloning this to your desktop or you can create a folder on your desktop to store your assessments, just be sure you are using git commands in the correct folder!

      - Make sure to create a branch. 

  - Open the repo
    - Let's look at the readme
    - Navigate to link for expectations
      - PLEASE READ THROUGH THIS THOUGHOUGLY!

  - Valid effort on each problem
  - Psuedocode on code challenges is REQUIRED!
    - Pseudocode is not repeating the promp, but going into depth on the methods and logic you are using.  Always err on the side of OVER COMMUNICTION
    - If you are stuck, write out what you have tried, your thoughts behind it and what errors your are running into

  - Copying answers from the internet does not help you, it hurts you. You are encouraged to use resources such as the syllabus or google if you are not sure how to approach a problem (cause that is what developers do everyday), however simply copying code or answers does not show a valid effort and will be returned to you.

 
  - Once complete, submit a PR
  - DO NOT MERGE UNTIL PR IS APPROVED
  - We will review the PR and leave you feedback
  - Keep an eye out for if there are changes requested
  - Approval means you are good to merge and this means your assessment is complete
