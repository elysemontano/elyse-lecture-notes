# CAPSTONE!

Capstones are projects that are completely your creation, from concept to completion you and your team will use your creativity and skills to create an application that solves something.  This project is going to be an accumulation of all of the skills you have acquired over the past several months.  

Inside the syllabus, there are 2 pages that have crucial information about your capstone projects.  The first is the Capstone Requirements.

## Capstone Requirements
While we try to give you a bit of creative freedom with this project, we do have certain requirements that is expected to be reached by the end of day 10 on this project.  

### Project Requirements
- React frontend application supported by a Rails API: Like Apartment App, you will have an application that has the Model and Controllers handled on the Rails side, and React will handle the views
- Full CRUD: Your app MUST have the ability to create, read, update and delete entries in the database using a user interface CRUD (should be done by day 5)
- User authentication with Devise
- Minimum of two database tables: User from devise is considered one table, you need to come up with at least one other.
- 60% testing coverage: This is actually a pretty low standard for the industry.  The average you will run into is anywhere between 70-90% coverage in the tech industry.  60% means that you have 60% coverage for Rails using Rspec, and 60% coverage for React with React Testing Library
- Deployed product: We use Render to deploy our capstones as the first 3 months are free. We will talk more in depth about this with each group toward the end of your first sprint
- A well written README: There is a link on the syllabus that can help in what is meant by a well written readme.  Make sure to take the time and look at that.
- About us page: I find that a lot of groups forget about this and the README until the last few days.  This is your chance to show future employers who you are, don't ignore this!
- Demo with your team: This will be at the end of day 10.  Highly recommend rehearsing this!

### Project Stretch Goals
Once ALL of the above (your MVP) is complete roughly by end of day 5, you can start thinking about the stretch goals.  These can include:

- Responsive design
- Accessibility
- Continuous Integration
- External API's (Will be doing a lecture next week covering some details on this)

### Important Notes
- What has worked the best in the past for groups is to put ALL of your focus on completing these project requirements FIRST.  This can be done in 5 days.  After that, start doing all the other cool things like adding in components, API's, styling, etc.  The groups that have focused on styling in the first week, often scramble to complete these requirements on the last day of capstone.  Save yourself the stress, and complete the requirements first. 
    MVP should be done by Friday (can you ship the product and pass)

- What you think will be "easy" will likely take more time than you think.  Focus on the priority things first so that you are not crunched for time to meet the requirements at the very end.

- Keep it simple.  You can create some really cool projects with simple structure and styling.  Don't over complicate things.

- Know what your comfort zone is and perhaps try something that you are not so comfortable in.  Meaning, if you haven't spent a lot of time on CSS and you want the opportunity to explore it, be transparent with your team and let them know that.

- You are in this together as a team, and we want each of you to get the chance to work together.  Alongside that, make sure that everyone has the chance to contribute and feels included in the process.  Your teammates success is your success.

- ** When the syllabus says organization and clear communication is the key to a successful team experience, it is not lying to you.  The most successful teams I have seen took this very seriously.  The groups that have struggled in the past did not put organization and communication high on their priority. **  

- Stress is often very high during Capstone so make sure to give yourselves and each other grace especially since you will be spending a lot of time with your team (80 hours +)

- Make sure to keep focused!  Coming up with new ideas is great, but can derail the team if you don't keep your focus on the prioritized tasks.  


## Project Details
Green light is a pitch meeting where you are meeting with a client that has asked you to produce a product and you go through all of the details of the different possibilities of how the application could work.  

To get to this green light meeting, we have a prep list to follow:
- Create a team name (this is not the same as your app name)
- Create a slack channel within the LEARN workspace (make sure to add me)
- Create a team email address
- Create a team GitHub Organization
      - Must be set to public
      - Add team members and instructors as owners
      - Slack integration can be done after you have a repo
- Create a Trello Board
      - Add all team members and instructor
- Create a Render account
- Decide on developer roles

## Developer Roles
The developer roles are positions that each of you on your team will be held responsible for.  That is to say that EVERYONE is responsible for coding and participating, but the roles are essentially making a designated person the point person for that particular role.  Once again, to clearly explain this, these responsibilities of the role DO NOT solely land on that one person, it means that if I have a question about something that falls into one of these categories, I will ask the person leading that role.

** Groups of 4 ** 
Product Manager:
A product is something we produce to serve a client.  The product manager has the big picture vision of the product.  Their goal is to focus on specifically the end result of the product and what will be handed to the client at the end.  

      - Ensures the product meets all requirements.
      - Must have strong management skills to provide support to the team and keep team unblocked.
      - Manages the conversation around large changes to the app.
      - Ensures the README contains appropriate information.
      - Gives progress updates to the class at the end of the day.

Project Manager:
The project manager is focused on the human side of the project and the workflow of the dev team.

    - Takes ownership on internal team communication. Oversees the project management board.
    - Must have strong communication with the team about who is working on what.
    - Guardian of the Trello board.
    - Ensures developers are assigned to the card they are working on.
    - Notifies the instructors of PRs when a card is moved to the PR swimlane.
    - Keeps Slack active with updates and pins appropriate content.
    - Manages external resources.
    - Gives status updates to the class at the beginning of the day.

Tech Lead/Anchor:
Takes ownership over the code base and version control.

    - Must have a strong understanding of the technical needs of the project.
    - Guardian of GitHub.
    - Merges code when appropriate.
    - Surfaces blockers to the class at the beginning of the day.


Design Lead: 
Takes ownership over the look, color scheme, and branding of the project.

    - Must have a strong understanding of the UI/UX needs of the application.
    - Guardian of the wire frames.
    - Oversees color schemes and implementation of branding.
    - Ensures intuitive navigation and user experience.
    - Explores styling libraries, responsive design, and accessibility features.
    - Gives user status updates to the class at the end of the day.


** Groups of 3 **

Same thing but product and project manager is combined.  This is a large responsibility and as a result this person may be coding a little bit less that the rest of the team


## Green Light Meeting
The green light meeting can start as early as Friday and will take approximately 30 minutes to an hour.  This is where you meet with me and show the prep work that you have done and walk me through your product pitch.  Once I have vetted your idea and am confident that you will be able to accomplish this, I will give you the green light to start coding. At this meeting, you will be expected to show up with:

 - Elevator pitch - 30 sec summary of the app
 - Wireframes - visual representations of all the pages your user will see for your MVP
 - DB schema drawn out with column names, data types, and table relationships
 - CRUD actions (CRUD endpoints for their tables are notated in Trello, defined on how that looks for the schema, and reflected in wireframe)
 - User stories for your MVP on Trello


Let me just put this out there, the groups that take the time to efficiently plan their product will most likely reach MVP quicker than those who rush through the planning phase.  Planning is not to be underestimated in it's importance in the development process.  

That being said, be prepared to not get the green light the first go around.  I will spend a lot of time with you to make sure that your product will be achievable within 10 days.  I dig deep and make sure you have a strong understanding and agreement on all the above aspects of your application.

This ultimately is your project that you are owners on.  I am here to support you, not to take over your project.  This is your product so stand by your product.


## Trello
Swim lanes
    Icebox: ALL cool ideas that are NOT part of the requirements will go in this swim lane
    MVP: Required tasks for project
    Doing
    Code review
    Done


## Schedules
This project will have a total of 10 days to code.  I would highly recommend come up with ideas as a team that you know you can create in 5 days, this will give you some buffer (back to the it may take longer than you think it will).  

A typical day may look like this:

    9:00 - Check in with the class

    9:15 - Morning standup with the class
    - Project: What tasks did you complete yesterday? What task are you working on today?
    - Tech: What are your blockers? 

    9:30 - Check in with your group and discuss the plan for the day
    - What story is each person working on?
    - What is the goal for the day?
    - What story / branch are you currently working on?

    9:30 - Pair up and start coding, remember to take breaks regularly and take breaks at the same time

    12:00 - Lunch

    1:00 - Coding

    4:15 - Wrap up with your group
    - Reflect on the progress you made throughout the day
    - Move any cards completed and discuss the next steps
    - Surface any blockers
    - Discuss actions items for tomorrow

    4:30 - Afternoon standup with the class
    - Product: What did your team do today that got your application closer to the requirements of the project?
    - Design: What did your team do today that increased your user's experience?

    4:45 - Check out with the class


Standup is a short meeting that is meant to update your team on certain progress markers.  This is a very common practice in Agile Development which we will be hearing from Adam Cuppy about.
