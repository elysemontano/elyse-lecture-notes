## Figma - wireframe

- Figma is going to feel very similar to photoshop and illustrator.  Your going to have layers, and windows that allow us to modify certain aspects of what we are designing.

- For starters, we are going to need something to work off of.  This currently is not nessessarily a piece of paper for us to draw on yet, we need to tell it that we need something here.
