# Assessments

## Links: 
You will recieve a link from myself or Trish each week.  This week we will provide it in the main channel.  Following weeks will be sent individually.  If you do not recieve an assessment link, it means that you have something you need to tend to with the previous weeks assessment.

## Git Process
- You will clone the assessment.
- add, commit, and push code
- We will cover PR submission on Tuesday 

## Skill levels are NOT grades:
Skill level means that we are assessing your current level of understanding of the topics covered.

  - Incomplete: No answer, no pseudocode, non working code without explanation, plagerism (We will send this back to you!)
  - Complete: Bare minimum effort given (if you don't put in the effort, I won't either)
  - Novice: Provides pseudocode, code can output in the terminal (may not be accurate), answers are written in your own words (will provide feedback)
  - Advanced Beginner: pseudocode with proper vocab, correct output, your answers written in complete sentances and partially correct, researched answers written in complete sentances and provides adequeite context and content
  - Competent: Detailed pseudocode, correct content in terminal, your answers are thourough and will provide correct answers.


  I must see A VALID ATTEMPT ON EVERY QUESTION!
