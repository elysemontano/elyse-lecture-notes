# Ruby Intro

Ruby is a dynamic, interpreted, open-source, object-oriented scripting language.  Ruby was released in 1995 by a computer scientist named Yukihiro Matsumoto, but in the Ruby community is commonly known as Matz.  He is a very benevolent and respected leader in the Ruby world and has a very pleasand and kind demeanor so much so that there is a saying in the Ruby community "Matz is nice and so we are nice" or MINASWAN.

Matz looked at all the pros and cons of popular programming languges at the time and realized that alot of programming langueges were all based around the needs and focus was on the computer, which he thought was silly because a computer doesn't care about the languages, but humans are the ones who are doing all of the work and they are the ones that are putting all the effort and emotion into creating the code.  So he set out with the idea to create a programming lanugage that focused on the needs of the human programmer instead of the computer.  Because he put the programmer happiness first and foremost over the computer, Ruby is known as a very human friendly launguage.

## Vocab
Now that we have some of the history, let's talk about some of the vocab.

### Dynamic
I mentioned that Ruby is dynamic, which means that Ruby just like Javascript is dynamically typed.  A dynamically typed programming language means that when you create a variable, you can give it whatever data type you want and then later on if you want to change that variables data type, you can. 

In contrast, if a language is not dynamic, it is known as statically typed where when you set a variable to a data type like a string, that is the only thing that it can hold.
