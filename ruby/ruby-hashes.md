# Ruby Hashes
So far when talking about Ruby, we have discussed a few different data types.

- Boolean
- Integers
- Floats
- Nil
- String

And a data type that we have not covered yet is something called Ruby Hashes.  In Javascript, we have this thing called key value pairs that we see in objects.  In Ruby, a custom key value pair is called a hash.  Objects still exist in Ruby since Ruby is an object oriented programming language, just a hash is a specific kind of object.

So let's take a look at this hash thing.
