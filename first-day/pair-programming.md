# Pair Programming


## Pair Programming Why and How
- Pair programming is a very common practice in the tech industry.  While movies portray coders inside a dark room with a black hoodie coding by themselves all day, that is a movie myth!


## What Is It?
- Pair programming is where two people collaborate together on one code source.  Together they will produce one program


## Questions
- Advocates for pair programming might say…
    -  2 heads are better than one
    -  Less mistakes
    -  Faster production
    -  More people know more aspects of the code 
    -  Easier to learn
    -  Creates community mindset “We are in this together”
    -  More accountability


## Why
- Pair programming increases specialization 
    -  Different people come with different knowledge and strengths
    -  Two people problem solving often leads to better results and solutions
    -  Distributes cognitive load making it easier to perform individual tasks, catch mistakes and produce higher quality code.
        - Coding takes a lot of brain power, so sharing brain power helps distribute the weight and causes less fatigue.
    - Less shortcuts are taken
        -  Hold each other to a higher standard creating less shortcuts
    - Not distracted by other tasks

## Why (cont..)
- COMMUNICATION!!!
    -  You are here to become great software developers.  Communication and problem solving are the main skills you will be practicing every day.
    -  Coding is communication with your machine
    -  Development is communication with your colleagues
    -  The most important thing your code does is communicate to both your machine, to you and to your colleagues.
    -  Helps to articulate problems and talk with others about your code.  This helps deepen your understanding along with others' understanding.
    -  Practice vocabulary and talk through your problems (aka.  “Rubber ducking”)


## How: The Ingredients
- What does pair programming look like?
    -  There are 2 super cool people with their own experience, perspectives and levels of coding coming together to create 1 program. 
    -  There is one Github repo, one code base, and one person typing at a time (you will be taking turns) which brings me to the roles!

## The Roles
- The two different roles in pair programming:
    -  Driver
        -  Handles the typing, clicking and managing of the text editor.
   -   Navigator
        -  Watches, advises, thinks (out loud to process with the other person)
        -  Responsible for main logic being implemented in the code
        -  Catching errors, bugs, typos
    -  Both roles are incredibly important and help to create a healthy balance.  While pair programming is not always easy, the pros outweigh the cons.  Let’s explore some situations that make pair programming difficult and some suggestions to help form a better collaborative experience

## How Do We Communicate

  ### Scenario 1
    - Scenario: I’m driving and feel like my navigator is not engaged
        -  First off, don’t get angry and do separate work.
        -  Suggest taking a break.  Once you get back, spend a few minutes to come up with a plan of action and set some goals.  Hold each other accountable and stick to the plan.

  ### Scenario 2
    - Scenario: My partner just made a suggestion that I know won’t work.  I want to go in another direction.
        -  Don’t squash their idea by saying “No that won’t work”
        -  Explore the idea anyways.  Set a time frame to explore the idea.  You may be pleasantly surprised by the outcome or the new ideas brought forth in the process.  This could also be a good way of explaining why something doesn’t work.

  ### Scenario 3
    - Scenario: I am very new to coding and my partner seems to know way more than me.  I feel like I am just following along and not learning for myself.
        -  Please don’t sit quietly feeling defeated!
        -  Reach out for help from your partner.  Giving them the space to teach actually deepens their understanding as well making it a win win for both of you!
        -  It is also ok to ask your partner to slow down or talk through the process.  Take notes on confusing points and either review later or ask your partner for clarification.

  ### Scenario 4
    - One last scenario: I have more coding experience than my partner.  I feel like they are not contributing and I am left to do all the work.
        -  Don’t take that as an invitation to do the work alone.
        -  Help your partner by teaching.  It could be they are feeling defeated like in the last scenario, so this is a good opportunity to be a team player and help support them by clarifying and breaking things down for them.  Remember, being able to teach requires a higher level of understanding than being able to do.


## The Process
- When pair programming, it is important to occasionally switch roles to allow both people the opportunity to operate in each role evenly.
    -  One method is to switch every 10-25 minutes
    -  Or using the pomodoro method which breaks up tasks into 25 minute chunks
        -  Work on task until timer rings, then take a break for 3 - 5 minutes
        -  After you get back from your break, switch roles and repeat the process.

## The Process (cont...)
- A few last things:
    -  In this class, a great collaboration tool we will be using extensively is GitHub which you will learn more about tomorrow.
    -  Each pair will be working on a project to together and be sharing through GitHub
    -  Each person can use whatever dev tools they are most comfortable with.  In other words, if your partner uses vs code and you use atom, that is ok!  The code will look, feel, and do the same thing regardless of your text editor.
    -  The driver will share their screen and have their hands on the keyboard
    -  The navigator will talk through the coding process
    -  When switching, the project will be shared with your partner via Github
    -  Lastly, if you are not sharing your screen as a driver, your hands should not be typing!  Make sure that the navigator knows how to guide you by allowing them to see what you are doing!
