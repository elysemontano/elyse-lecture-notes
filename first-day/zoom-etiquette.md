# Zoom Etiquette:

## Zoom Etiquette
I want to talk a little about zoom etiquette.  We will be spending 40 hours a week together on zoom and so we want to set some expectations and discuss some tools we use in zoom.

## Video
Video is really important in our learning experience.  Being able to see each other’s faces is so valuable as it makes us feel more connected with each other and keeps us better engaged.  It also helps keep each person more accountable by being presentable on a daily basis as if you are going to work.
Being able to see your faces also really helps the instruction team be able to teach you better.  Body language is a very important factor when we teach and can help us read whether or not we need to clarify something or when to take breaks.

## Video Etiquette
Many people opt to use virtual backgrounds which is perfectly acceptable, however please be conscientious about the image you chose.  You will be meeting a variety of people in the industry that may lead to your next job and so it is important to keep backgrounds professional and work safe.
You will also be sharing your screen often to your classmates and to the instructors and so it is important to be aware of what content you have on your computer and if it is not work safe, it is not LEARN safe either.

## Audio Etiquette
Please make sure to mute yourself when you are not talking.  It can be very distracting during lectures or presentations if those who are not speaking have a hot mic.  We always want to encourage you to unmute yourself when you have questions, but please make sure to mute once you are done talking.

## Virtual Classroom
We open the classroom at 8:45am PST and class will start promptly at 9am.  Please come early and ready.  Keep in mind that if you wait until 8:59 to open zoom, usually when you are running right on time technology likes to throw curveballs and decides to restart making you late.  Best practice is to open zoom at 8:45 and then grab your coffee and anything else.  If you are late, please make sure to communicate with us through slack on your cohort channel.  
When we take breaks, you are encouraged to keep zoom open, just simply turn off your microphone and video.  We will have specific times that each break will end and will communicate that via slack.  Please make sure you are back with your camera on promptly when the break is over.

## Asking Questions During Lecture
Asking questions is a very important of the learning process and we want to encourage you to ask lots of questions!  Please feel free to unmute yourself and ask away.  Chances are other students will have similar questions.  
Zoom does have a chat box feature, however the chat is very hard to see when a presenter is sharing their screen so please use verbal questions if something is not clear
I do want to encourage to use the chat feature to affirm others. 

## Lecture Recording
Most of our lectures are recorded, however we only use these recordings for internal use.  Videos from recorded lectures will be hosted on YouTube but unlisted so that only those with a direct link can access them.  
When we do record, there is a loud and obnoxious announcement to notify you that you are being recorded.  You must agree to be recorded each time.
The lectures will be available for you to go back and watch.  You will be able to find the links to the lecture recordings on your class’s google drive called LEARNers 2022 Foxtrot.  A link to the drive is in the description on your slack channel

## Breakout Rooms
We will often use a feature in Zoom called breakout rooms for pair programming, group projects, and team building exercises.  A breakout room is a sub-meeting in the zoom session.  Breakout rooms are opened and closed by the Zoom host.
When using this feature, you will be allowed to navigate to break out rooms as needed.  When you are in a breakout room, you can leave breakout room to go back to the main room by clicking the button that will take up the space where currently leave meeting is.  You will also be able to join a new breakout room by clicking on the breakout room tab on the bottom toolbar and click join on the room you wish to join.  When we open breakout rooms, we will post the groups along with the room you will be assigned to.
When we close the breakout rooms, there will be a 1 minute countdown and then you will be teleported back to the main room.

## Other Tools
There are several different viewing options in zoom.  To see all the faces in the class you can click view at the top left and select gallery.  
You can also change your display name by clicking on your display name and selecting the rename option.  It is very helpful for everyone to rename to your preferred name especially this first week as we all get to know each other.
Another neat feature is the annotation tool when a person is sharing the screen.  This is helpful when trying to point out a specific section on the screen that you are referring to.  You can do this by clicking “view options” at the top of the screen when someone is sharing and select annotate.  Please use this appropriately.
Sometimes you may end up with an extra option when leaving a zoom meeting.  Please do not ever end meeting for all!

## Internet Issues
Sometimes unstable internet happens, some troubleshooting tips when that happens would be first to close out other applications on your computer.  If this does not help, try the good old trick of turn off and back on again.  Start with zoom, and if that doesn't work, restart your computer or modem (or both).  Video can sometimes take up alot of bandwidth in zoom, so if your internet is being finicky, temporarily turn off your video, but please make sure to notify the group in slack.  
If your wifi is consistently unstable, consider getting a hub or dongle that allows you to hardline an ethernet cable to your mac.

## Reactions
Now for some fun stuff!  Zoom has a feature called reactions on the bottom toolbar which is a fun and helpful way to engage with a visual response.  Use these appropriately and as often as you like!  In fact, I would love to see everyone use a reaction!
