# Apartment App Intro (Mock Dev)

- Apartment App is traditionally a solo project.  We have migrated this experience to be a combination of a solo project while being a part of a team.  This is to imitate a relatively relistic experience you may face in the development world.  

- What this will look like, is that we will be splitting you up into 4 development teams, where collectively you will build a full stack, monolithic application with devise.  Each person will be responsible for the tasks assigned to them individually, however I want to encourage team work.  If you are struggling with the card you have been assigned, talk to your team. 

- Since there will be 4 groups, that means that there will also be 3 other classmates that are/have/or will work on that same task.  Talk to other groups as well if you are struggling.  If you are unable to make progress after reaching out to your peers, please reach out to your project manager (myself, or Trish).  

- Each Trello card is crucial to the entire build, so EVERY person's contribution is vital to the end goal.  

# Trello

Let's take a look at our Trello board

- We have several swim lanes that resemble what you did in Cat Tinder.  We will follow this process again.  

- As mentioned before, you will be assigned a card to work on.  This DOES NOT MEAN YOU CAN WORK ON SOMETHING ELSE!!!  Your team is counting on you completing the task that you have been given, especially since some of these tasks cannot be completed until another card has been merged to main.

- Pay close attention to the details inside the card you have been assigned.  Do not veer from it.  Follow proper git managment as well.  Branch names are at the top of the card and will be what we look for when you submmit a PR along with all items from the checklist.  

- Once you merge a branch, you should checkout main, pull from main to update your local and checkout a your next branch.

- Your next task will be assigned when a PR is approved by your project manager.

- When we get to styling (ONLY AFTER MVP IS REACHED!), you will be following the wireframe provided.  It will be common practice that you will be provided a wireframe from a designer that you will then need to build it to resemble it.  Often times, the wireframe has been approved by the client and the client is expecting exactly that.

# Setup

- To get started, I am going to send 4 of you the link to the github classroom.  You will create the team name (the name of your room), and let me know when you have done that.

- Once the team is generated, everyone can click on the github classroom link and join the team.

- We will now ALL go through the first Trello card together as this will ensure everyone is up and running and ready to work.  This is the time to work through any blockers.

- Once every person has initial environment setup running, send everyone off into breakout rooms to work on the second card.  The second card is mobbed, so there is only one driver!  Once this PR has been submitted, PM will assign each team member their tasks.
