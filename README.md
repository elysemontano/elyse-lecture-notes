# Teaching Web Development
This repo is a record of all lecture notes for a 16-week Ruby on Rails web development bootcamp. Preparing lectures is time consuming and requires very clear organization.  I opted to store my lecture notes on GitHub to allow version control on the updates I make to any lecture.
